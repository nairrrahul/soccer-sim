# About

A simple soccer simulator created using React. Currently supports one-off match simulation, with custom tournament & a 'continuous' football manager-like simulation to be supported in the future.

The project can be viewed online at https://nairrrahul.github.io/soccer-sim. This will be deployed periodically.

There will be a companion python application. This application will be a standalone simulation which shows full intended functionality of this webpage. The python application functions as a terminal, command-line style program. Further explanation will come & be linked when said repository is published.
